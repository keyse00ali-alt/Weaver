## Data Models

### Appliance
```python
id: str                    # Unique identifier (UUID)
name: str                  # Appliance name
power_usage_kw: float      # Power consumption in kW
duration_seconds: int      # How long appliance must run
deadline: datetime         # Must complete by this time
matter_device_id: str      # Matter device identifier
```

### Household
```python
id: str                          # Unique household identifier
household_type: str              # "grid_only" | "grid_and_pv" | "grid_pv_and_bess"

## Scheduling Algorithms

### Grid-Only (Simple Sliding Window)
- Scans all possible 30-minute windows until deadline
- Selects window with minimum total cost
- Time complexity: O(n) where n = number of price periods

### Grid + PV (Solar Priority)
- Considers both prices and solar production forecast
- Scores windows by: (solar_kwh × 100) - grid_cost
- Maximizes self-sufficiency while minimizing cost

### Grid + PV + BESS (Optimal with Storage)
- Simulates energy flow: Solar → Appliance → BESS → Grid
- Respects 20% BESS buffer to prevent over-drainage
- Prioritizes cheap window + available stored energy
- Recharges battery from excess solar

## API Integration Notes

### Real Price Data (ENTSO-E) ✓ IMPLEMENTED
Real Irish day-ahead prices are now integrated using your ENTSO-E API token:
- Token: `dda12809-fde2-4828-afe0-ac84ef1ee62a`
- Data Source: ENTSO-E Transparency API
- Coverage: Ireland bidding zone (10IEA-TRAN------M)
- Update Frequency: Daily at 13:00 UTC (day-ahead prices)
- Price Format: EUR/kWh (converted from EUR/MWh)

**Intelligent Fallback Strategy:**
- If current day's prices cannot be fetched, the system automatically uses **previous day's prices shifted to today**
- This is based on the assumption that consecutive days follow similar price patterns
- Cached prices are stored locally in `data/price_cache/`
- Provides service continuity when ENTSO-E API is temporarily unavailable

### Real Solar Forecasts (Open-Meteo) ✓ IMPLEMENTED
Real solar irradiance forecasts are now integrated using the free Open-Meteo API:
- Data Source: Open-Meteo Forecast API
- Irradiance Metric: Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) hourly
- Coverage: Global (all locations)
- Forecast Range: Up to 16 days ahead
- No API Key Required: Free and publicly accessible
- Update Frequency: Updated multiple times per day

The system automatically fetches location-based solar irradiance forecasts for all scheduling requests with PV.

## Error Handling

### 400 Bad Request
- No feasible schedule found within deadline
- Missing required fields (e.g., `current_bess_soc_kwh` for BESS scheduling)
- Empty price or solar data

### Example Error:
```json
{
  "detail": "No feasible schedule found within deadline"
}
```

## Testing

Example using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/schedule/grid-only" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "appliance": {
      "name": "Washing Machine",
      "power_usage_kw": 2.5,
      "duration_seconds": 3600,
      "deadline": "2026-04-20T22:00:00",
      "matter_device_id": "device-123"
    },
    "household": {
      "id": "h1",
      "household_type": "grid_only",

      "pv_capacity_kw": 0,
      "bess_capacity_kwh": 0,
      "bess_min_soc_percent": 20
