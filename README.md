# Weaver

Weaver is a local-first smart energy scheduler for Matter appliances.

It runs inside the user's home network, commissions Matter devices through a local Matter controller, and schedules flexible appliances around grid prices and optional solar production.

## What Weaver Does Now

- Connects Matter appliances with a manual setup code or `MT:` QR payload.
- Runs connected On/Off Matter appliances immediately.
- Schedules flexible appliance loads against a grid price signal.
- Supports two home modes:
  - Grid only
  - Solar + grid
- Uses a local FastAPI backend and a Next.js frontend.

## How Price Scheduling Works

Weaver is built for flexible appliances: devices that do not need to start immediately, but do need to finish before a deadline. Examples include a dishwasher, washing machine, dryer, water heater, or EV charger.

When you choose a city, Weaver uses that location to fetch local electricity price data and plan the run. The scheduler works in 30-minute blocks and looks for a start time that finishes before the appliance deadline.

In grid-only mode, Weaver uses a cheapest-window algorithm. It sorts through the available price periods, estimates the cost of running the appliance in each possible window, skips windows that would miss the deadline or exceed the configured home load limit, and chooses the lowest-cost valid window.

In solar + grid mode, Weaver gives priority to using your own solar power first. This matters because self-consuming rooftop solar is often worth more than exporting it, especially when export rates are lower than import prices. The scheduler scores each possible run window by estimating how much of the appliance load can be covered by forecast solar production, then uses grid price optimization for the remaining energy. In practical terms: run when your panels are expected to produce, and use cheaper grid periods as the backup.

Grid + solar + BESS mode is planned, but not completed yet. BESS means battery energy storage system, such as a home battery. The goal is to support homes where Weaver can coordinate appliance demand with rooftop solar, stored battery energy, and grid prices together.

The intended BESS algorithm would use available solar first, then battery energy above a reserve buffer, and then grid power for any remaining demand. It would also account for charging the battery from excess solar. This mode depends on home batteries becoming more broadly controllable through Matter, so Weaver currently focuses on grid-only and solar + grid scheduling.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- Node.js 20+
- Python 3.13 recommended
- A Matter appliance that can be put into pairing mode
- The Windows computer running Weaver and the Matter appliance on the same home network

## Before You Try It

Weaver is an early local app for testing Matter appliance scheduling. It is best suited for people who are comfortable running PowerShell commands and trying software that may need troubleshooting.

Useful feedback includes:

- Whether install and startup worked on your machine.
- Whether Weaver could commission your Matter appliance.
- What appliance type, brand, and model you tested.
- Any error messages from the PowerShell windows or the app.
- Places where the setup instructions were confusing.

## Quick Start on Windows

Open PowerShell, then go to the Weaver folder:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\Desktop\Weaver
```

If PowerShell says scripts are disabled, allow scripts for this PowerShell window only:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

Install Weaver once:

```powershell
.\install.ps1
```

Start Weaver:

```powershell
.\start-weaver.ps1
```

The start script opens separate windows for the local Matter Server, Weaver backend, and Weaver frontend. Leave those windows open while using Weaver.

Weaver should open automatically. If it does not, open this address in your browser:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

Put the Matter appliance into pairing mode, click Connect Device in Weaver, and enter the device's Matter setup code or `MT:` payload.

After the first install, normal startup is just:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\Desktop\Weaver
.\start-weaver.ps1
```

To stop Weaver, close the Weaver PowerShell windows or run:

```powershell
.\stop-weaver.ps1
```

You can also start Weaver from File Explorer by opening the repo folder and opening `Start Weaver.vbs`. To stop Weaver from File Explorer, open `Stop Weaver.vbs`.

## Uninstall

To remove Weaver's installed dependencies from this folder:

```powershell
.\uninstall.ps1
```

This removes the Python virtual environment, frontend dependencies, and build caches. It keeps local Weaver app data by default.

To also remove local Weaver app data, including Matter Server state:

```powershell
.\uninstall.ps1 -RemoveData
```

## Matter Notes

Matter commissioning and control are local-network operations. The machine running Weaver should be on the same home network as the Matter appliance.

Weaver uses the same open-source Matter Server used by Home Assistant:

```text
python-matter-server
```

The local architecture is:

```text
Weaver UI
  -> Weaver FastAPI backend
    -> Home Assistant Matter Server
      -> Matter appliance
```

The Matter Server handles the low-level Matter protocol work: discovery, secure commissioning, fabric credentials, node storage, secure sessions, and Matter cluster commands. Weaver handles the user experience, scheduling, and optimization decisions.

By default, Weaver connects to the Matter Server at:

```text
ws://127.0.0.1:5580/ws
```

The Matter Server stores its local state under:

```text
.weaver/matter-server
```

This local state is not committed to Git.

## Pairing a Matter Appliance

1. Make sure the computer running Weaver and the Matter appliance are on the same home network.
2. Put the appliance into pairing mode.
3. Open Weaver.
4. Click Connect Device.
5. Enter the device's Matter setup code.
6. Weaver commissions the appliance through the local Matter Server.

## Development Checks

Frontend:

```powershell
cd .\frontend
npm.cmd run lint
npm.cmd exec tsc -- --noEmit
```

Backend:

```powershell
cd .\Models\MatterEnergyScheduler
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m ruff check main.py src tests
```

## Local Files Not Committed

The repo ignores local generated files such as:

- `node_modules/`
- `.next/`
- `.venv/`
- `.env`
- logs
- local SQLite databases
- Matter runtime state
- Python bytecode caches

## Advanced Manual Starts

`start-weaver.ps1` is the normal way to run Weaver. These commands are only for starting individual services while developing or troubleshooting.

Start only the Matter Server:

```powershell
.\start-matter-server.ps1
```

Start only the backend:

```powershell
cd .\Models\MatterEnergyScheduler

$env:MATTER_SERVER_WS_URL="ws://127.0.0.1:5580/ws"
$env:FRONTEND_ORIGINS="http://localhost:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3000"
$env:WEAVER_LIVE_PRICES="0"

.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Start only the frontend:

```powershell
cd .\frontend

$env:NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8000"

npm.cmd run dev -- --hostname 127.0.0.1
```
